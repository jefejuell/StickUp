### **Description:**  
SticksUp is a website project that was created as a neighborhood business to service our client's lawns by picking up sticks and debris.  The logo and motto were created by my daughters, and they are co-owners of the business with me.  We have received testimonials, and we have crafted a pricing structure that clients can inquire about on the ContactUs webpage.

### **Usage**
To view SticksUp, please visit https://jefejuell.github.io/StickUp-WebsiteProject. 

### **Roadmap of future improvements**
Additional features will be to modify the html and js files to use the created DOM parent and child nodes throughout the site to create alerts and gather more information from users/clients.
