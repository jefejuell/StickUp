### **Description:**  
SticksUp is a website project that was created as a neighborhood business to service our client's lawns by picking up sticks and debris.  The logo and motto were created by my daughters, and they are co-owners of the business with me.  We have received testimonials, and we have crafted a pricing structure that clients can inquire about on the ContactUs webpage.
